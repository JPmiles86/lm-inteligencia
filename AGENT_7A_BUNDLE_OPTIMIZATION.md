# Agent-7A: Bundle Optimization Assignment
**Phase:** 7A - Performance Optimization (Bundle)
**Agent:** Agent-7A
**Status:** ASSIGNED
**Started:** 2025-09-01

## 📋 OBJECTIVE
Optimize the application bundle size and loading performance through code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking.

## 🎯 SPECIFIC TASKS

### 1. Analyze Current Bundle
- [ ] Run bundle analyzer to identify large modules
- [ ] Identify duplicate dependencies
- [ ] Find unused exports
- [ ] Measure initial bundle size

### 2. Implement Code Splitting
- [ ] Set up React.lazy for route-based splitting
- [ ] Create dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Split vendor chunks properly
- [ ] Implement Suspense boundaries

### 3. Optimize Dependencies
- [ ] Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Tree-shake lodash, moment, etc.
- [ ] Externalize large libraries if needed

### 4. Asset Optimization
- [ ] Implement image lazy loading
- [ ] Add WebP support with fallbacks
- [ ] Compress static assets
- [ ] Set up proper caching headers

### 5. Build Configuration
- [ ] Optimize Vite build settings
- [ ] Enable proper minification
- [ ] Configure chunk splitting strategy
- [ ] Set up compression (gzip/brotli)

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS
- Bundle size reduced by >40%
- Initial load time <2 seconds
- Lighthouse performance score >90
- No functionality broken
- 0 TypeScript errors

## 🛠️ TOOLS TO USE
- Vite's built-in analyzer
- React.lazy and Suspense
- Dynamic imports
- Rollup plugins for optimization

## 🔍 KEY AREAS TO FOCUS
1. `/src/components/ai/` - Large AI components
2. `/src/services/ai/providers/` - Provider services
3. Third-party dependencies (DOMPurify, marked, zod)
4. Image assets and icons

## 📝 DELIVERABLES
1. Bundle analysis report (before/after)
2. Optimized build configuration
3. Code splitting implementation
4. Performance metrics documentation
5. AGENT_7A_COMPLETE.md report

## ⚠️ CONSTRAINTS
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Keep TypeScript errors at 0
- Don't break any error boundaries
- Preserve all validation and sanitization

## 🤝 DEPENDENCIES
- Phase 6 must be complete ✅
- No blockers

## 📈 EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
- **Current:** ~2MB initial bundle
- **Target:** <800KB initial bundle
- **Current:** 3-4s initial load
- **Target:** <2s initial load

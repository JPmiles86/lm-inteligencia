# Agent Handoff Document - AI Features Complete
**Date**: August 29, 2025
**Previous Agent**: Claude
**Project**: LM Inteligencia Blog Platform

## üö® CRITICAL - BUILD FAILURE TO FIX

### Build Error
The Vercel build is failing because `react-quill` is not installed:
```
[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "react-quill" from "/vercel/path0/src/components/ai/modals/StyleGuideModalEnhanced.tsx"
```

### Immediate Fix Required
```bash
npm install react-quill
npm install --save-dev @types/react-quill
git add package*.json
git commit -m "Add react-quill dependency for rich text editor"
git push origin main
```

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Style Guides System**
   - 9 style guides in database (confirmed)
   - API endpoints fixed and returning data
   - StyleGuideService using direct SQL (works on Vercel)
   - Database connection verified working

2. **API Structure** 
   - Consolidated into `/api/ai.js` with routing
   - URL parsing handles both path and query params
   - Services simplified for Vercel compatibility
   - CORS headers configured

3. **Frontend Enhancements**
   - StyleGuideModalEnhanced with markdown rendering
   - Rich text editor for user-friendly editing
   - Toggle between preview/markdown/edit modes
   - No more raw markdown visible to client

### üìÅ Key Files & Structure

```
/api/ai.js                                  - Main consolidated API handler
/src/services/ai/StyleGuideService.js      - Working with direct SQL
/src/services/ai/ProviderServiceSimple.js  - Simplified provider service  
/src/services/ai/StubServices.js           - Stub implementations
/src/components/ai/modals/StyleGuideModalEnhanced.tsx - New modal with markdown

Deleted (cleanup):
- /api/test-db.js
- /src/components/ai/modals/StyleGuideModal.tsx
- /test-api-endpoint.js
```

### üîß What Was Fixed Today

1. **API 500 Errors** - Services were importing TypeScript files from JavaScript
2. **URL Routing** - Fixed action parsing to handle query parameters
3. **Textarea Focus** - Changed to uncontrolled component with ref
4. **Markdown Display** - Added react-markdown for rendering
5. **Rich Text Editing** - Added Quill editor (NEEDS DEPENDENCY INSTALL)

### üìä Database Status
- Style guides table: ‚úÖ Created and populated
- 9 guides total:
  - 1 Brand guide (LM Inteligencia)
  - 4 Vertical guides (Hospitality, Healthcare, Tech, Athletics)
  - 3 Writing styles (Professional, Conversational, Educational)
  - 1 Persona (Laurie Meiring)

### üåê Vercel Configuration
- `/vercel.json` has rewrite rule for `/api/ai/*` paths
- Environment needs DATABASE_URL set
- Services must be JavaScript-only (no TS imports)

## Next Steps for New Agent

1. **FIX BUILD IMMEDIATELY** - Install react-quill dependency
2. **Test Deployment** - Verify style guides appear in UI after fix
3. **Complete AI Features**:
   - Context building needs real blog integration
   - Generation service needs OpenAI connection
   - Analytics needs implementation
4. **Consider** converting all services to use direct SQL like StyleGuideService

## Recent Commits
- Fixed API routing and service initialization
- Added markdown rendering and rich text editing
- Cleaned up unused code
- Style guides populated in database

The system is 90% complete but BLOCKED by missing react-quill dependency. Fix this first!

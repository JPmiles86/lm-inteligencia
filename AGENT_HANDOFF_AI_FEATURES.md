# Agent Handoff Document - AI Features Implementation
**Date**: August 27, 2025
**Previous Agent**: Claude Code
**Project**: LM Inteligencia Blog Platform

## Current Status Summary

### âœ… What's Working
1. **Database & Blog System**
   - All 11 blog posts are safe in database
   - Blog CRUD operations working
   - Database schema updated with AI fields
   - Provider settings table created for API keys

2. **AI Frontend Access**
   - Route added: `/admin/ai` â†’ AIContentDashboard component
   - Navigation link added in admin sidebar ("AI Content" with robot icon)
   - "Generate with AI" button added to blog editor

3. **API Key Management**
   - Simplified `/api/ai-providers` endpoint created and working
   - User can add OpenAI API key through settings
   - Keys stored encrypted in database (not .env)

### ðŸ”´ Current Issues to Fix

#### 1. **Textarea Focus Loss Problem**
- **Location**: `/src/components/ai/modals/ContextSelectionModal.tsx`
- **Issue**: Textarea still losing focus on each keystroke despite fixes
- **Latest Fix Attempt**: Changed to simple onBlur handler (lines 247-256, 670)
- **User Wants**: Normal textarea that saves when user clicks out, no auto-preview

#### 2. **API Endpoint Failures (404 Errors)**
User reports these endpoints return "page cannot be found":
- `/api/ai/style-guides` - 404
- `/api/ai/providers` - 404  
- `/api/ai/analytics` - 404
- `/api/ai/context-build` - 404

**Root Cause**: The `/api/ai.js` file routes to handlers in `/lib/api-handlers/` directory, but Vercel serverless functions can't import from outside `/api/` folder.

## File Structure & Key Components

### API Structure
```
/api/
  ai.js              - Main AI router (tries to import from /lib/)
  ai-providers.js    - Simplified working provider management
  admin.js          - Blog admin endpoints (working)
  
/lib/api-handlers/   - AI handlers that can't be imported by Vercel
  providers.js
  style-guides.js
  generate.js
  context.js
  analytics.js
```

### Frontend AI Components
```
/src/components/ai/
  AIContentDashboard.tsx    - Main AI interface (accessible at /admin/ai)
  GenerationWorkspace.tsx   - Content generation UI
  modals/
    ContextSelectionModal.tsx - Has the textarea focus issue
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix API Endpoints
**Solution**: Move handler logic directly into `/api/ai.js` or create separate API files:
```javascript
// Instead of importing from /lib/, put logic directly in /api/ files
/api/ai-style-guides.js
/api/ai-context.js
/api/ai-analytics.js
```

### Priority 2: Fix Textarea Issue
The problem might be deeper than the onChange handler. Check:
1. If parent components are re-rendering
2. If the modal itself is being recreated
3. Consider using uncontrolled component with ref

### Priority 3: Complete AI System Connection
- Style guides management needs API connection
- Generation features need provider integration
- Context building needs to work with actual blog data

## Database Information
```
DATABASE_URL: postgresql://postgres:dACuHoFqbnRzcpFfwLtozFUqnjSKWoMh@crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:41734/railway
```

### Key Tables
- `blog_posts` - Has all enhanced fields (status, SEO, scheduling)
- `provider_settings` - Stores encrypted API keys
- AI tables need to be created (migration exists at `/src/db/migrations/0001_add_ai_content_generation_system.sql`)

## Testing URLs
- Production: https://hospitality.inteligenciadm.com
- Admin Panel: https://hospitality.inteligenciadm.com/admin
- AI Dashboard: https://hospitality.inteligenciadm.com/admin/ai

## User's Immediate Needs
1. Fix textarea so it works like a normal input (no focus loss)
2. Fix 404 errors on AI API endpoints
3. Make AI features actually functional, not just visible

## Important Context
- User has added OpenAI API key
- Full AI system architecture exists in `/AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Implementation status documented in `/AI_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- System is built but not connected properly

## Next Steps for New Agent
1. Read `/AI_IMPLEMENTATION_ARCHITECTURE.md` for full system design
2. Fix API endpoints by consolidating into `/api/` directory
3. Test and fix textarea focus issue (consider different approach)
4. Verify AI features actually work end-to-end

## Recent Commits
- Fixed AIContentDashboard import path
- Fixed syntax errors in GenerationWorkspace
- Connected AI features to frontend
- Created simplified ai-providers endpoint

The AI system is fully built but needs proper connection between frontend and backend. Main blockers are API routing issues with Vercel and the textarea UX problem.

# Task: Implement Rich Text Editor for Blog System

## Assignment
Create a Rich Text Editor (TinyMCE-style) for the blog management system. This editor should provide a familiar WYSIWYG interface for content creation with comprehensive formatting and media handling capabilities.

## Context
- **Location**: `/Users/jpmiles/lm-inteligencia/`
- **Existing Infrastructure**:
  - Blog service at `src/services/blogService.ts` (uses localStorage)
  - Blog management components at `src/components/admin/BlogManagement/`
  - Admin panel accessible at `/admin` (login: laurie@inteligenciadm.com / Inteligencia2025!)
  - Blog visibility currently disabled via admin settings

## Requirements

### 1. Rich Text Editor Component
Create `src/components/admin/BlogManagement/RichTextEditor.tsx`:
- Use TinyMCE React or Quill.js
- Full toolbar with formatting options
- Image upload/management interface
- Link insertion with target options
- Table creation and editing
- Code block support with syntax highlighting
- Emoji picker
- Find and replace functionality

### 2. Editor Features
**Text Formatting**:
- Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough
- Headings (H1-H6)
- Font family and size selection
- Text color and background color
- Alignment (left, center, right, justify)
- Lists (ordered, unordered, checklist)
- Blockquotes
- Horizontal rules

**Media Management**:
- Image upload via drag & drop or file picker
- Image resize handles
- Image alignment (left, center, right, full-width)
- Alt text and caption fields
- Gallery creation
- Video embed (YouTube, Vimeo)
- File attachments

**Advanced Features**:
- Undo/redo with history
- Word count and character count
- Auto-save every 30 seconds
- Full-screen editing mode
- Preview mode (show as it will appear)
- HTML source code view
- Paste from Word cleanup
- Keyboard shortcuts

### 3. Integration Points
- Integrate with existing `BlogEditor.tsx`
- Use `blogService.ts` for saving/loading
- Store content as HTML string
- Handle image storage in localStorage (base64 for MVP)

### 4. Blog Post Management
Enhance the editor to support:
- Post scheduling (date/time picker)
- Draft/Published/Scheduled status
- Categories and tags management
- SEO metadata (title, description, keywords)
- Featured image selection
- Excerpt editor
- URL slug editor with auto-generation
- Author information

### 5. Storage Approach (MVP)
For initial testing with localStorage:
```javascript
{
  id: string,
  title: string,
  slug: string,
  content: string, // HTML from rich text editor
  editorType: 'rich',
  excerpt: string,
  featuredImage: string, // base64 for MVP
  images: string[], // array of base64 images
  author: {
    name: string,
    title: string,
    image: string
  },
  status: 'draft' | 'published' | 'scheduled',
  publishDate: Date,
  scheduledDate?: Date,
  category: string,
  tags: string[],
  metaTitle: string,
  metaDescription: string,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### 6. UI/UX Requirements
- Clean, professional interface
- Responsive design for tablet/desktop
- Loading states for image uploads
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Tooltips for all toolbar buttons
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### 7. File Structure
```
src/components/admin/BlogManagement/
  RichTextEditor.tsx (main editor component)
  RichTextToolbar.tsx (toolbar component)
  ImageUploadModal.tsx (image management)
  LinkInsertModal.tsx (link management)
  ScheduleModal.tsx (scheduling interface)
  
src/utils/
  editorHelpers.ts (HTML cleanup, validation)
  imageCompression.ts (resize/compress images)
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Install TinyMCE React or Quill.js
2. Create base RichTextEditor component
3. Implement toolbar with all formatting options
4. Add image upload/management functionality
5. Implement auto-save and draft management
6. Add scheduling and metadata fields
7. Integrate with existing BlogEditor.tsx
8. Test with localStorage limitations
9. Document any limitations or future improvements

### Deviations from Original Plan:

1. **TinyMCE Selection**: Chose TinyMCE React over Quill.js for its more comprehensive built-in features and better documentation.

2. **Modal-based Image Upload**: Instead of inline image management, used a dedicated modal for better UX and file organization.

3. **Simplified Emoji Support**: Relied on TinyMCE's built-in emoticon plugin rather than a separate emoji picker.

4. **Auto-save Approach**: Implemented browser localStorage auto-save rather than server-side due to MVP constraints.

### Known Limitations:

1. **Storage Constraints**: 
   - localStorage has ~5MB limit
   - Base64 encoding increases image size by ~33%
   - No server-side image optimization

2. **TinyMCE API Key**: 
   - Currently using "no-api-key" for development
   - Production deployment will need proper TinyMCE Cloud API key

3. **Scheduled Publishing**: 
   - Requires manual check to publish scheduled posts
   - No automated background task for publishing

4. **Image Management**: 
   - No image resizing controls in editor
   - Limited gallery functionality
   - No external image service integration

5. **SEO Features**: 
   - Basic meta fields only
   - No advanced SEO analysis
   - No social media preview

### Future Enhancement Suggestions:

1. **Server Integration**:
   - Move to server-side image storage
   - Implement proper image CDN
   - Add automated scheduled post publishing
   - Database storage for better scalability

2. **Enhanced Editing**:
   - Add image editing tools (crop, resize, filters)
   - Implement collaborative editing
   - Add version history and revision tracking
   - Custom block/component creation

3. **SEO & Analytics**:
   - Advanced SEO analysis and recommendations
   - Social media preview generation
   - Content readability scoring
   - Performance analytics integration

4. **User Experience**:
   - Distraction-free writing mode
   - Better mobile responsive editing
   - Keyboard shortcuts customization
   - Template system for common post types

5. **Content Management**:
   - Bulk operations on posts
   - Advanced search and filtering
   - Content categorization improvements
   - Tag management with auto-suggestions

### Performance Considerations:

1. **Image Compression**: 
   - Automatic compression to 80% quality
   - Maximum width of 1200px to reduce storage usage
   - Warning system when approaching storage limits

2. **Auto-save Throttling**: 
   - 30-second intervals to prevent excessive localStorage writes
   - Debounced content changes to improve editor responsiveness

3. **Lazy Loading**: 
   - TinyMCE plugins loaded on demand
   - Image preview generation only when needed

4. **Memory Management**: 
   - Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
   - Efficient state management with minimal re-renders

### Testing Results:

- ✅ All major formatting options work correctly
- ✅ Image upload and compression functional
- ✅ Auto-save operates every 30 seconds
- ✅ Preview matches final output
- ✅ Scheduling system works as expected
- ✅ SEO metadata saves correctly
- ✅ Editor handles large content files
- ✅ Storage monitoring accurately reports usage
- ✅ Editor type switching maintains data integrity

### Completion Status:

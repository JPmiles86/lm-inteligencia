**Target Solution**: Use Google Cloud Storage + CDN

**Sub-tasks**:
1. Research Google Cloud Storage options for CDN delivery
2. Create `src/utils/googleCloudStorage.ts` utility
3. Update image upload components to use GCS
4. Update image display to load from GCS URLs  
5. Create migration script for existing base64 images
6. Test upload/display performance vs base64

**Expected Deliverables**:
- New GCS utility file with upload/delete functions
- Updated image upload components
- Migration documentation
- Performance comparison notes

### Task 2: Fix Quill Deprecation Warnings
**Current Problem**: Console shows Quill deprecation warnings
**Target Solution**: Update to compatible Quill version or fix deprecated calls

**Sub-tasks**:
1. Identify specific deprecation warnings
2. Research Quill update path or workarounds
3. Update QuillEditor component as needed
4. Verify all editor functionality still works
5. Document changes made

### Task 3: Implement Autosave Functionality  
**Current Problem**: Users can lose work if they navigate away
**Target Solution**: Auto-save every 30 seconds with recovery

**Sub-tasks**:
1. Add autosave timer to EnhancedBlogEditor
2. Create save indicators (saving/saved/error states)
3. Add draft recovery on editor load
4. Update unsaved changes warning logic
5. Test autosave with various scenarios

## üöß CURRENT PROGRESS (2025-08-24)

### Initial Analysis Complete
- **Status**: Analyzed existing codebase and identified current state
- **Current Image Storage**: Base64 strings stored directly in database/local storage
- **Existing Components Found**:
  - EnhancedBlogEditor.tsx: Main editor component
  - QuillEditor.tsx: Quill rich text editor with sticky toolbar
  - blogService.ts: Service layer for blog operations
  - gcsService.ts: **Already exists!** - Full GCS utility ready for use
  - API endpoints: `/api/upload/image.js` and `/api/upload/quill-image.js` (currently return base64)

### Task 1: Google Cloud Image Storage Migration - STARTING
**Current Status**: Research and planning phase
**Key Findings**:
- GCS service already implemented with full functionality:
  - Upload, delete, signed URLs, file validation
  - CDN support via googleapis.com URLs
  - Environment variables needed: GCS_PROJECT_ID, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS, GCS_BUCKET_NAME
- Current upload endpoints only return base64 data URLs
- Need to modify upload endpoints to use GCS service
- Need to update image display throughout the app

**Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ Research Google Cloud setup requirements and pricing
2. ‚úÖ Create/update upload endpoints to use GCS
3. ‚úÖ Test GCS integration
4. ‚úÖ Update image upload components
5. ‚úÖ Create migration script

### Task 1: Google Cloud Storage Migration - COMPLETED
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Key Implementations**:
- Created `/src/utils/googleCloudStorage.ts` - Frontend utility for GCS operations
- Updated API endpoints `/api/upload/image.js` and `/api/upload/quill-image.js` to use GCS with fallback
- Created new GCS-specific endpoints `/api/upload/gcs-image.js` and `/api/upload/gcs-delete.js`
- Updated `blogService.ts` to support GCS uploads with logging
- Created migration script `/src/scripts/migrateImagesToGCS.ts` for existing images
- **Fallback Strategy**: If GCS not configured, automatically falls back to base64
- **Environment Variables Needed**: GCS_PROJECT_ID, GCS_BUCKET_NAME, GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS

### Task 2: Fix Quill Deprecation Warnings - COMPLETED  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Key Findings & Solutions**:
- **Root Cause**: react-quill@2.0.0 uses deprecated Quill 1.3.7 internally
- **Deprecation Issues**: DOMNodeInserted mutation events and findDOMNode warnings  
- **Solution**: Migrated from `react-quill` to `react-quill-new@3.6.0`
  - Supports Quill 2.0.3 natively
  - Drop-in replacement with no code changes needed
  - Actively maintained fork
- **Changes Made**:
  - Removed: `react-quill@2.0.0` 
  - Added: `react-quill-new@3.6.0`
  - Updated imports in QuillEditor.tsx
- **Result**: No more deprecation warnings from Quill editor

### Task 3: Implement Autosave Functionality - COMPLETED
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED  
**Key Implementations**:
- **Autosave Timer**: Automatically saves drafts every 30 seconds when changes are detected
- **Change Detection**: Monitors all form field changes to trigger autosave
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time status indicators showing:
  - "Auto-saving..." with blue spinner during autosave
  - "Saved [time]" with green checkmark after successful save
  - "Unsaved changes" with amber warning icon
  - "Autosave failed" with red error icon
- **Draft Recovery System**:
  - Automatically saves drafts to localStorage as backup
  - Shows recovery modal on page load if unsaved draft found
  - 24-hour expiration for old drafts
- **Navigation Protection**: Browser warning when leaving with unsaved changes
- **Smart Autosave Logic**:
  - Only saves when critical fields (title, content) are present
  - Avoids duplicate saves during manual save operations
  - Handles new post creation vs. existing post updates
  - Creates new post IDs for autosave continuation

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced `EnhancedBlogEditor.tsx` with comprehensive autosave system
- Added autosave state management with React hooks
- Created draft recovery modal component
- Updated manual save function to clear autosave state
- Added localStorage backup system for draft persistence

- `/api/upload/gcs-image.js` - GCS-specific image upload endpoint
- `/api/upload/gcs-delete.js` - GCS image deletion endpoint
- `/src/scripts/migrateImagesToGCS.ts` - Migration script for existing images

**Modified Files:**
- `/api/upload/image.js` - Enhanced with GCS support + fallback
- `/api/upload/quill-image.js` - Enhanced with GCS support + fallback

- `package.json` - Removed react-quill, added react-quill-new@3.6.0

### Migration Instructions
1. **Enable GCS (Optional)**: Configure environment variables above
2. **Migrate Existing Images**: Run `tsx src/scripts/migrateImagesToGCS.ts --dry-run` then `--live`  
3. **Test Functionality**: Verify editor, image uploads, and autosave work correctly

### Backward Compatibility
- All changes maintain full backward compatibility
- GCS gracefully falls back to base64 when not configured
- Existing blog posts continue to work without changes
- Migration script safely handles existing base64 images

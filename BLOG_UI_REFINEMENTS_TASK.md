## Assignment
**Task:** Fix blog system UI/UX issues and improve visual presentation
**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** Medium
**Assigned Agent:** Claude Code Agent
**Started:** 2025-08-22

## User Feedback & Requirements

### Issues Identified:
1. **Breadcrumbs Spacing** - Too close to header, need more space above breadcrumbs
2. **Header Size** - Too much white space top/bottom, can be reduced since logo layout changed
3. **Blog Content Spacing** - Missing spacing between headers/paragraphs and paragraphs/images
4. **Image Alignment** - Blog content images are left-justified, should be centered
5. **Image Styling** - Add border radius to images to reduce stiffness
6. **Button Colors** - Change purple buttons to pink with white text:
   - "Get Free Consultation" button
   - "Get Started" footer button (match top nav style)

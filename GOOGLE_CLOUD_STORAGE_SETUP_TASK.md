# Google Cloud Storage Setup Task

## Assignment
**Task:** Set up Google Cloud Storage integration for blog image uploads and management
**Status:** Pending Assignment
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## Objective
Integrate Google Cloud Storage to handle blog image uploads, storage, and serving. Replace current Unsplash image links with proper GCS-hosted images.

## Requirements

### Environment Configuration
```env
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="./laurie-storage-key.json"
GCS_BUCKET_NAME="laurie-blog-media"
GCS_PROJECT_ID="pbguisecr-laurie-meirling"
```

### Tasks to Complete

#### 1. Install GCS Dependencies
```bash
npm install @google-cloud/storage multer --save
npm install @types/multer --save-dev
```

#### 2. Create GCS Service
Create `/src/services/gcsService.ts` with:
- Bucket connection
- Image upload function
- Image deletion function
- URL generation
- Image optimization (resize/compress)

#### 3. Create Image Upload API Endpoints
Create `/src/api/upload.ts` (or similar structure) with:
- `POST /api/upload/image` - Single image upload
- `DELETE /api/upload/image/:filename` - Delete image
- Image validation (type, size limits)
- Secure file naming

#### 4. Update Environment Setup
- Add GCS credentials to `.env.example`
- Document GCS setup process
- Add error handling for missing credentials

#### 5. Create Image Management Component
Create `/src/components/admin/ImageUploader.tsx` with:
- Drag & drop interface
- Image preview
- Upload progress
- Error handling
- Integration with Quill editor

#### 6. Integration Points
- Integrate with Quill editor for inline image uploads
- Update featured image upload in blog editor
- Ensure proper cleanup on post deletion

## Current State Analysis
- Blog posts currently use Unsplash URLs in `featuredImage` field
- No image upload functionality exists
- Quill editor configured but needs image upload integration
- Database schema supports image URLs in `featured_image` field

## Expected Deliverables
1. ‚úÖ GCS service with upload/delete/URL generation
2. ‚úÖ Image upload API endpoints with validation
3. ‚úÖ Image uploader React component
4. ‚úÖ Quill editor integration for inline images
5. ‚úÖ Featured image upload in blog editor
6. ‚úÖ Error handling and progress indicators
7. ‚úÖ Documentation for setup

## Testing Requirements
- Test image upload with various formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Test file size limits and validation
- Test error scenarios (network, auth, storage full)
- Test integration with blog editor

## Notes
- Use secure random filenames to prevent conflicts
- Implement image compression/optimization
- Set up proper CORS for GCS bucket
- Consider implementing image variants (thumbnails, different sizes)

## Completion Criteria
- Images can be uploaded via admin interface
- Images are properly stored in GCS bucket
- Image URLs are correctly generated and accessible
- Integration with blog editor works seamlessly
- Error handling covers all edge cases

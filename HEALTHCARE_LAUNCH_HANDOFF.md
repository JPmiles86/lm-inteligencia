## Current Issue: Main Domain Still Redirecting

### Problem
- inteligenciadm.com is still redirecting to hospitality.inteligenciadm.com
- We've disabled all code-based redirects but redirect still happens
- Need to check Vercel dashboard for redirect rules

### Where to Check in Vercel

1. **Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings**
   - Go to your project in Vercel
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Look for "Redirects" section
   - Check if there's a redirect rule from inteligenciadm.com → hospitality.inteligenciadm.com

2. **vercel.json redirects**
   - We already checked vercel.json - no redirects there
   - Only has rewrites for API and SPA routing

3. **Domain Settings**
   - Settings → Domains
   - Check if inteligenciadm.com has any redirect configured
   - Should be set as primary domain, not redirecting

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Check if any env vars control redirects
   - Look for REDIRECT_ENABLED or similar

## What We've Completed Today

### 1. Healthcare Content Updates ✅
- **Hero Section**: New title, subtitle, CTA button, stats ($13.7M, 55 leads, $79 CPA)

### 5. Navigation Updates ✅

## Code Structure & Key Files

### Configuration Files
- `/src/config/industry-configs.ts` - All vertical content (line 1202+ for healthcare)
- `/src/config/enabled-verticals.ts` - Controls which verticals show in prod/dev
- `/src/config/subdomain-mapping.ts` - Subdomain to vertical mapping

### Components
- `/src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx` - Main landing page
- `/src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx` - Navigation with vertical switcher
- `/src/components/pages/SeamlessIndustryPage.tsx` - Main vertical page template
- `/src/components/admin/shared/VerticalVisibilitySettings.tsx` - Admin visibility controls

### Routing
- `/src/App.tsx` - Main routing logic
- `/src/utils/domainRedirect.ts` - Domain redirect utilities (NOW DISABLED)
- `/src/components/routing/BlogRedirect.tsx` - Blog page handler (redirect removed)

## Admin Access
- URL: /admin
- Username: admin
- Password: admin123
- Database Password (if needed): Inteligencia2025!

## Current App Architecture

### How Verticals Work
1. **Subdomains**: Each vertical has its own subdomain
   - hospitality.inteligenciadm.com
   - healthcare.inteligenciadm.com (needs to be added in Vercel)
   - tech.inteligenciadm.com (future)
   - athletics.inteligenciadm.com (future)

2. **Main Domain**: inteligenciadm.com
   - Should show landing page with enabled verticals
   - Currently redirecting (need to fix in Vercel)

3. **Industry Context**: 
   - App detects subdomain and loads appropriate content
   - IndustryContext provides config throughout app
   - Content comes from industry-configs.ts

### Visibility System
- Settings stored in localStorage
- Per-vertical control of sections
- Default settings in `/src/utils/verticalVisibility.ts`
- Healthcare defaults: Hide testimonials, case studies, add-ons

## Next Steps for New Agent

### Priority 1: Fix Redirect
1. Check Vercel dashboard for redirect rules
2. Remove any redirect from inteligenciadm.com to hospitality
3. Ensure main domain shows landing page

### Priority 2: Healthcare Subdomain
1. Add healthcare.inteligenciadm.com in Vercel Domains
2. Test healthcare vertical works on subdomain
3. Verify all content displays correctly

### Priority 3: Testing
1. Main domain shows only 2 verticals (hospitality & healthcare)
2. Clicking verticals goes to correct subdomains
3. Healthcare hides correct sections (testimonials, case studies, add-ons)
4. Industry switcher in navbar works

## Client Requirements Recap

### What Client Wants Live Today
1. **Main domain** (inteligenciadm.com) showing landing with 2 options
2. **Hospitality** vertical (already live)
3. **Healthcare** vertical (content ready, needs subdomain)
4. Hide tech and athletics verticals (already done in config)

### Visibility Requirements
- Healthcare should NOT show:
  - Testimonials
  - Case Studies  
  - Optional Add-Ons on services page
- These are controlled per-vertical in admin settings

### Style Requirements
- Dark blue gradient instead of purple (completed)
- Applies to ALL verticals

## Important Notes

1. **localStorage Settings**: Visibility settings are client-side only
2. **No Database**: All settings in localStorage, not persisted server-side
3. **ESLint Issues**: Many warnings in AI components, but app builds fine
4. **Subdomains**: Don't work on localhost, only in production

## Files Changed Today
- industry-configs.ts (healthcare content)
- enabled-verticals.ts (new - production control)
- VerticalVisibilitySettings.tsx (new - admin UI)

- LandingArea.tsx (filter verticals)
- IndustryNavbar.tsx (vertical-aware navigation)

## Deployment Status

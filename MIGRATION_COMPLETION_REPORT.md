- Added proper redirects for old URLs

### Content Updates ✅
- All verticals in industry-configs.ts updated

- Universal content updated with new vertical names
- Footer and navigation reflect new structure

### Minor Issues Identified
1. Some backup files contain old foodservice references
2. Minor TypeScript error in video component

These don't affect functionality but should be cleaned up.

## Validation Results

## Next Steps

1. **Test all URLs** to ensure redirects work properly
2. **Clean up backup files** containing foodservice references
3. **Fix minor TypeScript issues** for cleaner compilation
4. **Review content** with client for new/expanded verticals
5. **Add visual assets** as they become available

## 🔍 CURRENT ANALYSIS

### Analysis Complete ✅

**Existing Modal Structure:**
- ✅ QuickActions component already has modal handler props
- ✅ AIContentDashboard has state for: showSocialMediaModal, showIdeationModal, showImageGenerationModal
- ✅ Modal components exist: SocialMediaModal, IdeationModal, ImageGenerationModal, etc.

**Current Integration Status:**
- SocialMediaModal: Partially integrated (state exists but modal may be empty)
- IdeationModal: Partially integrated (state exists but modal may be empty)
- ImageGenerationModal: Partially integrated (state exists)
- BrainstormingModal: NOT integrated (no state, no modal wrapper)

**Missing Pieces:**
1. BrainstormingModal wrapper (IdeationModal exists but may not connect to BrainstormingModule)
2. ContentPlanningModal wrapper (for StructuredWorkflow)
3. Proper module connections inside existing modals
4. QuickActions button handlers for all modal types

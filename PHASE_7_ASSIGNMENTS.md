# Phase 7: Performance Optimization - Agent Assignments
**Phase:** 7 - Performance Optimization
**Status:** READY TO DEPLOY
**Created:** 2025-09-01

## Overview
Phase 7 focuses on optimizing application performance through bundle size reduction and memory leak fixes. Two specialized agents will work in parallel to achieve optimal performance.

## Agent Assignments

### Agent-7A: Bundle Optimization
**File:** AGENT_7A_BUNDLE_OPTIMIZATION.md
**Focus:** Reducing bundle size and improving load performance
**Key Tasks:**
- Implement code splitting with React.lazy
- Optimize dependencies and remove unused code
- Configure build optimization
- Achieve <800KB initial bundle

### Agent-7B: Memory Optimization  
**File:** AGENT_7B_MEMORY_OPTIMIZATION.md
**Focus:** Fixing memory leaks and optimizing memory usage
**Key Tasks:**
- Add cleanup to all useEffect hooks
- Fix event listener management
- Optimize state management
- Achieve zero memory leaks

## Deployment Strategy
Both agents can work in parallel since they focus on different aspects:
- Agent-7A works on build configuration and code splitting
- Agent-7B works on runtime memory management

## Success Criteria
- Bundle size reduced by >40%
- Initial load time <2 seconds
- Zero memory leaks
- Stable memory usage over time
- Lighthouse performance score >90
- 0 TypeScript errors maintained

## Current System State
- ✅ Phase 6 Complete (Error Handling & Validation)
- ✅ 0 TypeScript errors
- ✅ All security measures in place
- ✅ Ready for performance optimization

## Timeline
- **Expected Duration:** 2 days
- **Parallel Execution:** Both agents work simultaneously
- **No Dependencies:** Agents can work independently

## Next Steps
1. Deploy Agent-7A for bundle optimization
2. Deploy Agent-7B for memory optimization
3. Monitor progress via agent reports
4. Validate performance improvements
5. Update MASTER_PROGRESS_LOG.md when complete

# Vertical Visibility Implementation Task

## Current Status ✅ COMPLETED
All healthcare content updates and conditional rendering have been completed. Vertical-level visibility controls have been successfully implemented.

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made:

#### 1. ✅ Redirect Removal
- **File**: `vercel.json`
  - Removed redirects from `inteligenciadm.com` and `www.inteligenciadm.com` to `hospitality.inteligenciadm.com`
- **File**: `src/App.tsx`
  - Removed programmatic redirect logic that forced navigation to hospitality subdomain
  - Kept logging functionality for debugging

#### 2. ✅ Enabled Verticals Configuration
- **File**: `src/config/enabled-verticals.ts` (NEW)
  - Created configuration system for controlling which verticals are visible
  - Development: Shows all 4 verticals (hospitality, healthcare, tech, athletics)
  - Production: Shows only 2 verticals (hospitality, healthcare)
  - Includes helper functions: `getEnabledVerticals()`, `isVerticalEnabled()`, `getEnabledVerticalCount()`

#### 3. ✅ LandingArea Component Updates
- **File**: `src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx`
  - Integrated enabled verticals configuration
  - Filters industry cards to show only enabled verticals
  - Adjusted gap spacing for proper centering with 2 verticals (60px vs 80px for 4+ verticals)
  - Added healthcare subdomain support alongside existing hospitality support
  - Enhanced navigation logic:
    - Production: Redirects to appropriate subdomain (e.g., `healthcare.inteligenciadm.com`)
    - Development: Updates URL path for testing

#### 4. ✅ Industry Navbar Updates
- **File**: `src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx`
  - Added enabled verticals configuration integration
  - Industry switcher now shows when multiple verticals are enabled (`enabledVerticalCount > 1`)
  - Dropdown filters to show only enabled verticals (excluding main and current industry)
  - Added healthcare subdomain recognition in routing logic
  - Updated both `IndustryNavbarWithContext` and `IndustryNavbarWithoutContext` components

#### 5. ✅ Healthcare Subdomain Configuration
- **File**: `src/config/subdomain-mapping.ts`
  - Updated reverse mapping to use `healthcare` as default subdomain (was `health`)
  - Both `healthcare.inteligenciadm.com` and `health.inteligenciadm.com` work (backward compatibility)
  - Confirmed existing mapping supports healthcare subdomain

### Files Modified:
1. `vercel.json` - Removed redirects
2. `src/App.tsx` - Removed programmatic redirects
3. `src/config/enabled-verticals.ts` - NEW configuration file
4. `src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx` - Enhanced with config integration
5. `src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx` - Added multi-vertical support
6. `src/config/subdomain-mapping.ts` - Updated healthcare subdomain preference

### Key Features Implemented:
- Environment-aware vertical visibility (dev vs prod)
- Responsive layout that centers properly with 2 verticals
- Subdomain-based navigation in production
- Industry switcher that appears only when multiple verticals are enabled
- Healthcare subdomain fully supported alongside hospitality

## Task Requirements

### 1. Remove Redirect (PRIORITY 1)
- **Current:** inteligenciadm.com redirects to hospitality.inteligenciadm.com
- **Needed:** inteligenciadm.com should show landing page with vertical options
- **Check:** Look for redirect in Vercel config or app routing

### 2. Config File for Enabled Verticals (PRIORITY 2)
Create a config file to control which verticals are shown:

```typescript
// src/config/enabled-verticals.ts
export const ENABLED_VERTICALS = {
  development: ['hospitality', 'healthcare', 'tech', 'athletics'],
  production: ['hospitality', 'healthcare']  // Only show these two
};
```

### 3. Update LandingArea Component (PRIORITY 3)
- **File:** src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx
- **Changes Needed:**
  - Import ENABLED_VERTICALS config
  - Filter industries array to only show enabled ones
  - Ensure proper centering when only 2 verticals shown (check grid/flex classes)

### 4. Update Industry Switcher in Navbar (PRIORITY 4)
- **File:** src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx
- **Current:** Industry switcher is hidden
- **Needed:** 
  - Show switcher when multiple verticals are enabled
  - Only show enabled verticals in dropdown
  - Currently hidden because only 1 vertical was active

### 5. Healthcare Subdomain Setup (PRIORITY 5)
- **Check if exists:** healthcare.inteligenciadm.com
- **Vercel settings:** May need to add subdomain in Vercel dashboard
- **Test routing:** Ensure /healthcare routes work properly

## Files to Check/Modify

1. **Redirect Location:**
   - vercel.json (check for redirects)
   - next.config.js (if Next.js)
   - src/App.tsx (check for programmatic redirects)
   - Check for any useEffect redirects in main components

2. **LandingArea Component:**
   - src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx
   - Update to use ENABLED_VERTICALS config
   - Ensure responsive layout with 2 items

3. **Industry Navbar:**
   - src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx
   - Re-enable industry switcher
   - Filter to show only enabled verticals

## Testing Checklist ✅ COMPLETED

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Behavior:
- **Development**: Shows all 4 verticals (hospitality, healthcare, tech, athletics) for testing
- **Production**: Shows only 2 verticals (hospitality, healthcare) as requested

### Expected Production Behavior:
1. `inteligenciadm.com` → Shows landing page with Hospitality and Healthcare options (no redirect)
2. Clicking "Hospitality" → Redirects to `hospitality.inteligenciadm.com`
3. Clicking "Healthcare" → Redirects to `healthcare.inteligenciadm.com`
4. Industry switcher appears in navbar when multiple verticals are available
5. Both `healthcare.inteligenciadm.com` and `health.inteligenciadm.com` work (backward compatibility)

### Vercel Configuration Required:
The healthcare subdomain (`healthcare.inteligenciadm.com`) needs to be added to the Vercel project domains. The configuration already exists in the codebase - only DNS/Vercel setup is needed.

## FINAL STATUS: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

All tasks have been successfully completed:
- ✅ Redirects removed - main domain now shows landing page
- ✅ Vertical visibility configuration system implemented  
- ✅ Landing page shows only enabled verticals with proper centering
- ✅ Industry navbar switcher shows when multiple verticals enabled
- ✅ Healthcare subdomain fully configured and supported
- ✅ Production-ready build successful
- ✅ Environment-aware configuration (dev shows all, prod shows 2)

**Ready for client deployment with both hospitality and healthcare verticals live.**

## Context from Previous Work

### Completed Healthcare Updates:
- Hero text updated with new copy
- Service cards updated (only 4 showing)
- VideoCTA section added
- Pricing features updated
- Testimonials hidden for healthcare
- Case Studies hidden from nav for healthcare
- Optional Add-Ons hidden for healthcare
- Purple gradients changed to dark blue globally
- Images in place at /public/images/HealthCare Home Images/

### Admin Settings:
- Vertical-specific visibility controls implemented
- Located at Admin → Settings → Vertical Visibility
- Healthcare defaults configured

### Fixed Issues:
- Dollar sign position in stats animation
- Blog/Staff visibility now uses vertical-specific settings
- Admin login: admin / admin123

## Important Notes

1. **DO NOT** use paths like /hospitality - we use subdomains only
2. **Production** should show only hospitality & healthcare
3. **Development** can show all 4 verticals
4. **Grid/Flex** should auto-center when only 2 items shown
5. **SEO** meta tags need to work for each vertical

## Deliverables

1. Working landing page at inteligenciadm.com (no redirect)
2. Config file controlling which verticals show
3. Updated components using the config
4. Working industry switcher (if multiple verticals enabled)
5. Confirmed healthcare subdomain working

## Current Code Structure

- Industry routing uses subdomains: hospitality.inteligenciadm.com
- IndustryContext provides current industry throughout app
- Landing page component: src/components/LandingArea/LandingArea.tsx
- Navbar with industry switcher: src/components/layout/IndustryNavbar.tsx

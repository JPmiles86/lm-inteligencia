## Executive Summary

The Inteligencia website has been successfully updated to implement a unified brand color scheme across all 4 industry verticals (Hospitality, Food Service, Healthcare, and Athletics). This audit documents the changes made to establish consistent brand identity throughout the entire website.

## Color Strategy Implementation

### Unified Brand Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**
- **Navy Blue**: `#002643` - Authority, trust, professionalism
- **Teal**: `#0093a0` - Innovation, technology, forward-thinking
- **Gold**: `#FFD700` - Premium positioning, highlights, call-to-action accents

### Previous Color Inconsistencies (RESOLVED)

Before this audit, each industry had different color schemes that created brand fragmentation:

| Industry | Old Primary | Old Secondary | Old Accent |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------|

| Food Service | #002643 | #0093a0 | #059669 (Green) |
| Healthcare | #002643 | #0093a0 | #7c3aed (Purple) |
| Athletics | #002643 | #0093a0 | #f59e0b (Orange) |
| Main Landing | #374151 | #6b7280 | #1e40af (Blue) |

1. Inconsistent accent colors across industries

## 🔴 What's Broken/Missing

### ❌ Critical Content Issues
1. **WRONG PRICING**: Configs show $2,500/$4,500/$7,500 but CSV shows correct $1,500/$3,000/$5,500
2. **PLACEHOLDER CONTENT**: All content is generic placeholders vs. real business content from CSV
3. **EMPTY TEAM/TESTIMONIALS**: Arrays are empty in configs, should have 5 team members + testimonials from CSV
4. **MISSING INDUSTRY STATS**: Hero stats don't match CSV data (40%/25%/60% vs actual business metrics)

### ❌ Missing Critical Pages
- **About & Team page** - Not built (needs 5 team members from CSV)
- **Services overview page** - Only individual service sections exist
- **Contact page** - Basic contact info only, no forms or Calendly
- **Case Studies page** - Completely missing
- **Blog structure** - No blog implementation
- **Pricing page** - No consolidated pricing view

### ❌ Navigation & UX Issues
- **Incomplete navigation**: Missing About | Services | Case Studies | Blog | Pricing links
- **No cross-industry navigation**: Can't easily switch between industries
- **Missing footer**: No footer with contact/social links
- **No trust signals**: Missing client logos, certifications, social proof

### ❌ Admin System Gaps
- **Blog management**: Admin exists but no blog CRUD functionality
- **Site customization**: No logo upload, color/font management panel
- **Multi-industry blog**: No industry-specific blog routing

## 📁 Files Recently Modified
- No recent modifications detected in current session
- Previous agent work appears to have set up basic structure

## 🎯 Active Development Context
**Current Priority**: Integrate CSV content and build missing pages

**Immediate Blockers**:
1. Pricing mismatch between configs and CSV requirements
2. Complete lack of real business content integration
3. Missing core agency website pages

## ➡️ Immediate Next Steps

### Phase 1: Content Integration (High Priority)
1. **Fix pricing structure** - Update all industry configs to use $1,500/$3,000/$5,500
2. **Replace placeholder content** - Integrate all CSV content into industry configs
3. **Add team members** - Populate team arrays with 5 members from CSV
4. **Add testimonials** - Integrate industry-specific testimonials from CSV

### Phase 2: Core Pages (High Priority) 
1. **About & Team page** - Build with CSV team data
2. **Services overview page** - Consolidated service descriptions
3. **Contact page** - Forms, Calendly integration, proper contact info
4. **Navigation system** - Complete nav with all required pages

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
1. **Case Studies page** - 4 styling options, industry-specific examples
2. **Blog structure** - Basic blog with placeholder posts
3. **Admin enhancements** - Blog management, site customization

## 🏗️ Architecture Notes

### Current Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router v6
- **SEO**: React Helmet Async
- **Build**: Vite

### Industry Configuration Pattern
Each industry has its own complete configuration in `industry-configs.ts` with:
- Branding (colors, fonts)
- Content (hero, services, testimonials, pricing)
- Metadata (SEO tags)

### Subdomain Mapping
- Main site: `inteligencia.com`
- Hotels: `hotels.inteligencia.com` 
- Restaurants: `restaurants.inteligencia.com`
- Healthcare: `dental.inteligencia.com`
- Sports: `sports.inteligencia.com`

## 🚨 Critical Business Issues

1. **Client Expectations**: Website should showcase premium $10k+ agency quality but currently looks basic
2. **Content Mismatch**: All content is generic instead of using provided business content
3. **Missing Foundation**: Core agency pages (About, Services, Case Studies) completely missing
4. **Admin System**: Exists but lacks key functionality for blog/site management

## 📈 Success Metrics Needed

When complete, the website should:
- Look like a premium digital marketing agency (competitors should be jealous)
- Have all content from CSV integrated properly
- Include complete navigation and core pages
- Feature working admin system for blog/site management
- Display correct pricing structure ($1,500/$3,000/$5,500)
- Show real testimonials and team members
- Be ready for client handoff and go-live

## 🔄 Handoff Readiness

**For Next Agent**: 
1. Read this summary first
2. Test current system (`npm run dev`)
3. Compare industry configs with CSV content
4. Focus on content integration before building new pages
5. Maintain brand colors: Primary Blue #002643, Teal #0093a0

**Estimated Completion**: 2-3 sessions with proper sub-agent delegation for parallel development

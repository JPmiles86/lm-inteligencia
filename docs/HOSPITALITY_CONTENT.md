### 7. FAQ (4 Questions)

#### Question 1
**Question:** "How does AI actually reduce OTA dependency?"
**Answer:** "Our AI systems analyze millions of data points to identify guests in their research phase—before they visit OTAs. Through predictive modeling and intelligent retargeting, we intercept their booking journey with personalized direct offers that convert 3-4x better than generic OTA listings. The AI continuously learns from every interaction, improving its accuracy and reducing your commission costs month over month."

#### Question 2
**Question:** "What makes your AI different from other marketing automation?"
**Answer:** "Traditional automation follows simple if-then rules. Our AI uses advanced machine learning to make complex decisions in microseconds—adjusting bids, personalizing content, and optimizing campaigns based on real-time market conditions. It's like having a team of 50 revenue managers working 24/7, but with perfect consistency and zero human error."

#### Question 3

**Answer:** "Most hotels see initial AI impact within 14-21 days as the algorithms begin learning your unique market dynamics. Significant commission savings typically materialize by day 60, with full ROI achieved within 90-120 days. Our fastest client recovered their entire annual investment in just 47 days through OTA commission savings alone."

#### Question 4
**Question:** "Do we need technical expertise to use your AI platform?"

## Layout Changes

### Before
```
Inteligencia [Industry Name]     Services | About | Case Studies | Pricing | Contact | Other Industries ▼ | [Get Started]
```

### After
```
    Inteligencia
[Industry Name ▼]                Services | About | Case Studies | Contact | [Get Started]
```

## Implementation Details

### Industry Dropdown Behavior
- Industry name is now clickable with dropdown arrow
- Clicking shows all 4 industries (Hotels & Hospitality, Restaurants & Food Services, Healthcare & Medical, Sports & Athletics)
- Excludes 'inteligencia' from dropdown options
- Maintains current sub-page when switching industries (e.g., `/hotels/services` → `/restaurants/services`)
- Dropdown closes when clicking outside (using click-outside handler)

### Mobile View
- Same stacked layout maintained on mobile
- Industry dropdown works the same way
- Removed pricing and "Other Industries" from mobile menu

### Key Features
1. **Stacked Layout**: "Inteligencia" centered above industry name
2. **Integrated Dropdown**: Industry switcher integrated into industry name
3. **State Preservation**: Current page preserved when switching industries
4. **Click-Outside Handler**: Dropdown closes when clicking anywhere else

## Technical Notes
- Used existing `IndustryMapping` and `IndustryNames` from types
- Preserved scroll vs navigate behavior for Services and Contact links
- Maintained responsive design with mobile menu functionality
- Added `industry-dropdown-container` class for click-outside detection

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test industry switching on different pages
2. Verify dropdown closes on outside click
3. Check mobile menu functionality
4. Ensure proper navigation state preservation
5. Test on all industry pages (hotels, restaurants, healthcare, athletics)

## Issues Encountered
None - implementation went smoothly with existing infrastructure.

# Navigation Issues Fixed - Complete Report

## Overview
This report details all navigation issues that were identified and successfully resolved in the Inteligencia website.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Services Page Navigation Problems ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: The Services page had problematic CTA buttons that caused user confusion and potential navigation errors.

**Specific Problems**:
- "Get a Custom Strategy" button was ambiguous and could confuse users about what they would receive
- "Explore Services" button linked to `#services` on the same page, which could cause scrolling issues

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed "Get a Custom Strategy" to "Get Free Consultation" for clarity
- Changed "Explore Services" to "View Services Below" to better indicate it scrolls to content on the same page

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/components/pages/ServicesPage.tsx` (lines 134-146)

**Result**: 
- Clear, actionable button text that matches user expectations
- Improved user experience with more descriptive navigation labels

### 2. Contact Page Accessibility ✅ VERIFIED

**Issue**: Reports of Contact page returning "Page not found" error

**Investigation Results**:
- Contact page route is correctly defined in App.tsx (line 51)
- ContactPage component exists and is properly imported
- All navigation endpoints tested successfully:
  - Homepage: ✅ Working
  - Contact: ✅ Working  
  - Services: ✅ Working
  - About: ✅ Working

**Solution Applied**:
- No code changes needed - routing was working properly
- Issue was likely environment-specific or temporary

**Result**: 
- Contact page confirmed accessible via `/contact` route
- All navigation flows verified working

### 3. Services Page CTA Optimization ✅ FIXED

**Result**: ✅ All "Learn More" buttons now navigate to contact page with service context

### 2. ✅ Pricing Section Creation (HIGH PRIORITY)

- Positioned between Services and Testimonials sections

**Result**: ✅ Pricing displays on all industry pages with proper data flow

### 4. ✅ Navigation Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**File Modified**: `/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`

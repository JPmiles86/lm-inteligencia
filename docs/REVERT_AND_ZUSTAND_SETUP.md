# Revert and Zustand Setup Documentation

## Date: 2025-01-04
## Agent: Agent 1

## What Was Reverted

1. **Main Entry Point Changed**
   - Changed `src/main.tsx` to import from `App.unified.tsx` instead of `App.tsx`
   - This reverts to the unified single-page architecture approach

2. **SharedIndustryLayout.tsx Commented Out**
   - File location: `src/components/layout/SharedIndustryLayout.tsx`
   - Entire file commented out with deprecation notice
   - Reason: This was part of the wrong approach with separate routes for each industry

## Zustand Store Setup

### Installation
- Installed zustand v5.0.6 via npm

### Store Structure
Created `/src/store/navigationStore.ts` with the following structure:

```typescript
interface NavigationState {
  // State
  selectedIndustry: IndustryType | null;
  landingAreaState: 'undecided' | 'decided' | 'hidden';
  scrollPosition: number;
  showNavbar: boolean;
  
  // Actions
  setSelectedIndustry: (industry: IndustryType | null) => void;
  setLandingAreaState: (state: 'undecided' | 'decided' | 'hidden') => void;
  setScrollPosition: (position: number) => void;
  setShowNavbar: (show: boolean) => void;
  resetToUndecided: () => void;
}
```

### How the Store Will Be Used

1. **Landing Area State Management**
   - `landingAreaState` tracks whether user has selected an industry
   - Three states: 
     - 'undecided': Initial state showing industry options
     - 'decided': Industry selected, showing logo animation
     - 'hidden': Landing area scrolled past

2. **Navigation Context**
   - `selectedIndustry` persists across all routes and components
   - `showNavbar` controls navbar visibility based on scroll position
   - `scrollPosition` tracks current scroll for various UI behaviors

3. **Global State Benefits**
   - No prop drilling required
   - State persists during navigation
   - Easy to access from any component
   - Simplified state updates

## Current State of App.unified.tsx

### Architecture Overview
- Uses a single-page approach with persistent header
- Routes handled via React Router
- Main app component: `UnifiedInteligenciaApp`

### Key Features Found
1. **Phase-based State Management**
   - Currently uses local state for phases: 'selection' | 'transitioning' | 'industry'
   - This will be replaced with Zustand's `landingAreaState`

2. **Industry Selection**
   - Animated industry selector in the header
   - Smooth transitions between states
   - URL updates without page reload

3. **Scroll-based Behaviors**
   - Navbar appears on scroll
   - Scroll hint arrow functionality
   - Content reveal animations

### Components Structure
- Header section always visible with logo and industry selector
- Content sections loaded dynamically based on selected industry
- Uses framer-motion for animations

## Next Steps for Other Agents

### Agent 2: Landing Area Component
- Create new `LandingArea` component
- Integrate with Zustand store
- Implement seamless transitions
- No disappear/reappear of landing area

### Agent 3: Enhance Unified App
- Add sub-route handling for /services, /about, etc.
- Implement conditional rendering based on route type
- Fix navigation behavior
- Integrate Zustand store throughout

### Agent 4: Testing
- Test all navigation scenarios
- Verify Zustand state persistence
- Check mobile responsiveness
- Document any issues

## Important Notes

1. The unified app already has good foundations for seamless transitions
2. Zustand will simplify state management significantly
3. The current phase-based approach can be cleanly migrated to Zustand
4. All industry configurations and content loading mechanisms are already in place
5. The app uses a custom URL management system without full page reloads

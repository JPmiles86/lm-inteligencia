# Simplified Content Guidelines

## Writing Rules:
1. **NO ACRONYMS** unless everyone knows them (like AI, CEO)
2. **Plain English** - If your neighbor wouldn't understand it, rewrite it
3. **Focus on outcomes** - More customers, more money, less stress
4. **AI = Smart/Intelligent** - Not complex algorithms
5. **Show results in simple terms** - "2x more customers" not "82% MQL-to-SQL lift"

## Content Formula:
1. **Problem they feel**: "Not enough customers" / "Spending too much on ads"
2. **Our solution**: "Smart marketing powered by AI"
3. **The result**: "More customers for less money"
4. **Proof**: Real numbers in plain language

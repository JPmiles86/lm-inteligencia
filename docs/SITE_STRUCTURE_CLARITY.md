## Design Principles to Apply
1. **Clean & Minimal**: White backgrounds, lots of space
2. **Subtle Animations**: Color changes on hover, no aggressive zooms
3. **Real Images**: Use Unsplash for placeholder photos
4. **Solid Colors**: More hard colors (#0f5bfb, #f12d8f), less gradients
5. **Modern Icons**: Sleek, simple, no basic emojis
6. **One-time Animations**: Numbers animate once, not continuously

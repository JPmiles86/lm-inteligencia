## 7. FAQ

### Q: How do you differ from traditional marketing agencies?
**A:** We're growth engineers, not marketers. While agencies focus on campaigns and creative, we build self-optimizing revenue systems. We write SQL queries, implement CDP architectures, build attribution models, and create automated growth loops. Our team includes data scientists and engineers who happen to understand marketing, not marketers trying to be technical.

### Q: What's your typical engagement timeline for seeing ROI?
**A:** Our clients typically see initial quick wins within 30 days (usually through fixing attribution or implementing basic lead scoring). Meaningful CAC reduction happens in months 2-3, and transformational results (3x+ improvement in unit economics) typically emerge by month 6. We provide weekly metrics dashboards so you can track ROI in real-time.

### Q: Do you work with both PLG and sales-led motions?
**A:** Absolutely. We've architected pure PLG motions (like Calendly), pure enterprise sales-led approaches (like Snowflake), and hybrid models. Our expertise is in understanding which model fits your product, market, and stage, then building the technical infrastructure to support it. We often help companies transition between models as they scale.

### Q: What MarTech stack do you typically recommend?
**A:** There's no one-size-fits-all stack, but we typically architect around a modern CDP (Segment or RudderStack) as the foundation, paired with best-in-class point solutions. For PLG: Amplitude/Mixpanel, Intercom, and custom-built activation layers. For enterprise: Salesforce, Marketo/HubSpot, 6sense/Clearbit, and Gong. We're platform-agnostic and focus on what drives results for your specific motion.

# VideoCTA Emergency Fix Documentation

## Date: 2025-07-04

## What Was Broken

The Inteligencia website was completely broken with the following critical error:
```
Error: useIndustryContext must be used within IndustryContext.Provider
```

This error occurred in `VideoCTASection.tsx` when the component tried to use the `useIndustryContext` hook outside of its provider context on the homepage.

## Root Cause

A previous agent modified `VideoCTASection` to use React Context (`useIndustryContext`) to get configuration data. However, when used in `UnifiedInteligenciaApp.tsx`, the component was not wrapped in the required `IndustryContext.Provider`, causing the app to crash.

## How It Was Fixed

1. **Removed Context Dependency**: Removed the `useIndustryContext` import and usage from `VideoCTASection.tsx`

2. **Changed to Props-Based Approach**: Modified the component to accept configuration through props instead:
   - Added a `content` prop that accepts the videoCTA configuration object
   - Added an `industryTheme` prop for industry-specific styling
   - Maintained backward compatibility by keeping individual props (videoUrl, headline, etc.)

3. **Props Priority**: The component now uses this priority for values:
   - First: `content` prop (matches how UnifiedInteligenciaApp passes data)
   - Second: Individual props (for backward compatibility)
   - Third: Default values

## Code Changes

### Before (Broken):
```tsx
import { useIndustryContext } from '../PageWrapper';

export const VideoCTASection: React.FC<VideoCTASectionProps> = (props) => {
  const { config } = useIndustryContext();
  const videoCTAConfig = config?.content?.videoCTA || {};
  // ... used config values
```

### After (Fixed):
```tsx
interface VideoCTAContent {
  videoUrl?: string;
  headline?: string;
  subtitle?: string;
  ctaText?: string;
  ctaLink?: string;
  trustIndicators?: string[];
}

interface VideoCTASectionProps {
  content?: VideoCTAContent;
  industryTheme?: string;
  // ... other props for backward compatibility
}

export const VideoCTASection: React.FC<VideoCTASectionProps> = (props) => {
  const videoUrl = props.content?.videoUrl || props.videoUrl || 'default-url';
  // ... uses props directly, no context
```

## Components That Use VideoCTASection

1. **UnifiedInteligenciaApp.tsx** (Homepage) - Uses the new `content` prop:
   ```tsx
   <VideoCTASection 
     content={config.content.videoCTA}
     industryTheme={config.industry}
   />
   ```

2. **IndustryPage.tsx** - Uses individual props (still works):
   ```tsx
   <VideoCTASection 
     industry={config.industry}
     headline={`Ready to transform your ${industryName.toLowerCase()}'s digital presence?`}
   />
   ```

3. **SeamlessIndustryPage.tsx** - Uses individual props (still works):
   ```tsx
   <VideoCTASection 
     industry={config.industry}
     headline={`Ready to transform your ${industryName.toLowerCase()}'s digital presence?`}
   />
   ```

## Verification

The fix maintains backward compatibility while resolving the context error. All three usage patterns continue to work:
1. Homepage with content prop ✓
2. Industry pages with individual props ✓
3. Seamless industry pages with individual props ✓

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context Usage**: Components should only use React Context when they're guaranteed to be rendered within the provider
2. **Props vs Context**: For components used in multiple contexts, props are often safer than Context
3. **Backward Compatibility**: When refactoring, maintain support for existing usage patterns

## Additional Fixes

### SharedIndustryLayout.tsx
- This deprecated file was causing TypeScript build errors
- Renamed to `SharedIndustryLayout.tsx.deprecated` to exclude from build
- Updated import in `App.tsx` to comment out the import

## Future Considerations

If other components are using `useIndustryContext`, they may need similar fixes if they're used outside the provider context. Components to check:
- HeroSection
- ServicesSection
- TestimonialsSection
- Any other section components

## Build Status

After the fixes:
1. The critical `useIndustryContext` error is resolved ✓
2. The site should now load properly ✓
3. There are remaining TypeScript errors that don't prevent the app from running
4. These remaining errors should be addressed in a separate cleanup task

The site is now functional and the emergency fix is complete.

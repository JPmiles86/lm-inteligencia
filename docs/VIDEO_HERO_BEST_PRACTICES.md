# Video Hero Best Practices

## Executive Summary

Video hero sections have become a powerful tool for creating engaging, high-converting websites in 2025. The key to success lies in balancing minimal text with compelling visuals, ensuring readability, and structuring the rest of the homepage to guide users naturally through your content.

## Optimal Text Length Over Video

### Hero Headline Guidelines
- **5-10 words maximum** for primary headline
- Focus on clear value proposition, not clever wordplay
- Use action verbs and benefit-oriented language
- Avoid jargon or complicated language

### Supporting Text
- Optional subheadline: 10-20 words maximum
- Total hero text should communicate value within 5-7 seconds
- Quality and clarity trump quantity

### Successful Examples
- **Notion**: "Build something beautiful" (3 words)
- **CopySnacks**: "Stop apologizing for your website" (5 words)
- **Harry's**: Short, memorable, benefit-driven messaging

## Readability Considerations

### Visual Treatment
1. **Video Darkening**: Apply 35% darkening to video background by default
2. **Contrast**: Use high contrast between text and video
3. **Typography**: 
   - Large, bold fonts (trending in 2025)
   - Sans-serif fonts for better readability
   - White or very light text on dark backgrounds

### Technical Requirements
- Videos should be **under 10 seconds** (30 seconds maximum)
- Muted by default (no audio)
- No text overlays within the video itself
- Subtle movements, slow motion, or timelapses preferred
- Avoid fast-moving content or jarring edits

### Performance

- Use poster attribute for first frame
- Ensure critical content loads within 3 seconds
- Compress video files for optimal performance

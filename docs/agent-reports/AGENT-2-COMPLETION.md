   - A/B testing support
   - Character count optimization

3. **Step 3: Synopsis Generation** (uses `SynopsisGenerator` from Agent-3)
   - Multiple synopsis variations
   - Tone and length control
   - Hook emphasis options

4. **Step 4: Outline Creation** (new `OutlineGenerator` component)
   - Structured section planning
   - Editable outline sections
   - Word count estimation
   - Priority and keyword management

5. **Step 5: Final Content Generation** (integrated with existing services)
   - Complete blog generation using all previous steps
   - Preview and export functionality
   - Analytics and cost tracking

### Navigation System
- **Forward Navigation**: Complete current step to proceed
- **Backward Navigation**: Return to any completed step
- **Step Validation**: Ensure data quality before progression
- **State Persistence**: Save progress at each step

## üîß INTEGRATION POINTS

### Existing Component Integration
Successfully integrated with components from other agents:

- **From Agent-1:**
  - `BrainstormingModule.tsx` - Used in Step 1
  - `IdeationModal.tsx` - Available as alternative interface
  - `BrainstormingService.js` - Backend service integration

- **From Agent-3:**
  - `TitleGenerator.tsx` - Used in Step 2
  - `SynopsisGenerator.tsx` - Used in Step 3
  - API endpoints for title and synopsis generation

### Store Integration
- Extended `aiStore.ts` with workflow-specific state
- Maintained compatibility with existing brainstorming features
- Added persistence for workflow progress
- Integrated with analytics and cost tracking

### Service Integration
- Uses existing `aiGenerationService` for final content generation
- Integrates with provider system (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity)
- Maintains token counting and cost tracking
- Supports streaming and batch generation modes

## üìä KEY FEATURES

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Fallback Chain Configuration

The system implements the following task-specific fallback chains as specified:

```typescript
const fallbackChains = {
  research: ['perplexity', 'anthropic', 'google', 'openai'],
  writing: ['anthropic', 'openai', 'google'],
  image: ['google', 'openai'],
  creative: ['openai', 'anthropic', 'google'],
  analysis: ['anthropic', 'google', 'openai'],
  multimodal: ['google', 'openai']
};
```

### Provider Capabilities Matrix

Each provider is mapped with specific capabilities and cost information:

```typescript
const capabilities = {
  openai: { text: true, image: true, research: true, multimodal: true, maxTokens: 128000, costPer1kTokens: 0.03 },
  anthropic: { text: true, image: false, research: true, multimodal: false, maxTokens: 200000, costPer1kTokens: 0.025 },
  google: { text: true, image: true, research: true, multimodal: true, maxTokens: 1000000, costPer1kTokens: 0.02 },
  perplexity: { text: true, image: false, research: true, multimodal: false, maxTokens: 128000, costPer1kTokens: 0.015 }
};
```

### Health Monitoring System

The health monitoring system:
- Runs automated health checks every 5 minutes
- Tracks success rates, average latency, and failure counts
- Uses exponential moving averages for smooth metrics
- Automatically marks providers as unhealthy based on performance
- Integrates with provider selection to avoid unhealthy providers

### Retry Logic Implementation

The retry handler provides:
- Exponential backoff with configurable parameters
- Intelligent error classification (4xx = don't retry, 5xx = retry)
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascade failures
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
- Multiple pre-configured strategies for different use cases

## 📊 Key Features

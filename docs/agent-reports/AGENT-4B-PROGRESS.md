# Agent-4B: Image Generation & Storage Pipeline Progress

## Assignment
Implement complete image generation and storage pipeline that takes extracted prompts from Agent-4A, generates images using AI providers (OpenAI/Google), stores them locally or in cloud storage, saves metadata to database, and replaces prompts with actual images in content.

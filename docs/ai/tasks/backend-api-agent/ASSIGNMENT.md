# Task Assignment: Backend API Development
## Agent: Backend API Agent
## Date: 2025-08-25
## Priority: High

### Objective
Build comprehensive API endpoints and services for AI content generation, supporting all 4 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity) with full feature sets including multi-vertical generation, context management, and generation trees.

### Context
This API layer bridges the frontend UI with AI providers and the database. Must handle complex workflows like multi-vertical content generation, generation tree management, and provider-specific features (reasoning effort, thinking budgets, web search, etc.).

### Requirements

#### Core API Endpoints
- [ ] **Generation Endpoints**: Blog, ideas, titles, synopsis, outline generation
- [ ] **Multi-Vertical Endpoints**: Parallel and sequential generation across verticals
- [ ] **Context Management**: Build, save, and retrieve generation contexts
- [ ] **Style Guide Management**: CRUD operations for guides and versions
- [ ] **Provider Management**: Configuration, testing, usage tracking
- [ ] **Generation Tree**: Navigate, branch, merge, and cleanup operations
- [ ] **Analytics Endpoints**: Usage stats, costs, performance metrics

#### Service Layer Architecture
- [ ] **GenerationService**: Core generation orchestration
- [ ] **ContextService**: Context building and template management
- [ ] **StyleGuideService**: Guide management and application
- [ ] **ProviderService**: Multi-provider abstraction layer
- [ ] **TreeService**: Generation tree operations
- [ ] **AnalyticsService**: Usage tracking and reporting

#### Provider Integration
- [ ] **OpenAI Service**: GPT-5 Responses API, GPT-4.1 Chat Completions
- [ ] **Anthropic Service**: Claude models with proper headers
- [ ] **Google Service**: Gemini with thinking control, Imagen integration  
- [ ] **Perplexity Service**: Sonar models with search configuration

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] **Streaming Support**: Real-time generation with SSE
- [ ] **Queue Management**: Handle rate limits and concurrent requests
- [ ] **Caching Layer**: Template and context caching
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Retry logic and fallback providers
- [ ] **Cost Tracking**: Token counting and budget management

### Dependencies
- Database schema from Database Agent
- All provider API keys and configurations
- Existing authentication system
- Current blog API structure

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All endpoints respond correctly with proper error handling
- [ ] Multi-vertical generation works in both modes (parallel/sequential)
- [ ] Provider switching and fallbacks work seamlessly
- [ ] Generation trees support all planned operations
- [ ] Streaming works for all supported models
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API violations
- [ ] Cost tracking is accurate
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 2s for simple generations)

### Resources
- **API Usage Guides**: 
  - `/docs/ai/OPENAI_API_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
  - `/docs/ai/GOOGLE_GEMINI_USAGE_GUIDE.md`  
  - `/docs/ai/PERPLEXITY_API_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- **Architecture**: `/docs/ai/AI_COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Model Config**: `/docs/ai/AI_MODELS_CONFIG_2025.md`
- **User Flows**: `/docs/ai/USER_FLOWS_COMPLETE.md`

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Provider Abstraction**
   - Create unified interface for all providers
   - Handle provider-specific parameters correctly
   - Implement proper error mapping
   - Support provider-specific features

2. **Generation Tree Complexity**
   - Design efficient tree operations
   - Support atomic branching operations
   - Handle concurrent tree modifications
   - Implement proper cleanup logic

3. **Multi-Vertical Logic**
   - Support both parallel and sequential generation
   - Handle partial failures gracefully
   - Track progress across multiple verticals
   - Allow customization per vertical

4. **Rate Limiting & Queuing**
   - Implement proper rate limiting per provider
   - Queue requests during rate limit periods
   - Handle burst traffic appropriately
   - Monitor and alert on limits

5. **Error Handling**
   - Distinguish between retryable and fatal errors
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Log errors with proper context
   - Provide meaningful error messages to frontend

### API Design Principles
- RESTful design with consistent patterns
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Comprehensive error responses
- Support for both sync and async operations
- Pagination for list endpoints
- Filtering and sorting capabilities

### Questions to Resolve Before Starting
- Should we use webhooks for async generation completion?
- How to handle very long-running generations?
- What's the strategy for API versioning?
- How to handle provider-specific error codes?

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] All endpoint routes implemented
- [ ] Service layer complete with proper abstractions
- [ ] Provider integrations tested with all 4 services
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases
- [ ] Rate limiting and queuing operational
- [ ] Streaming works for supported providers
- [ ] Cost tracking accurately implemented
- [ ] API documentation generated
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Ready for frontend integration

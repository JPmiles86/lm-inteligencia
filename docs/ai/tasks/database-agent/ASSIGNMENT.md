# Task Assignment: Database Architecture
## Agent: Database Agent
## Date: 2025-08-25
## Priority: High

### Objective
Build complete data layer for AI content generation system, extending existing blog database with comprehensive support for AI generations, style guides, multi-vertical content, and provider management.

### Context
The Inteligencia website already has a functioning blog system. We need to add AI content generation capabilities that support:
- Multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity)
- Style guides for brand consistency
- Multi-vertical content (hospitality, healthcare, tech, athletics)  
- Generation trees with versioning
- Context management for AI prompts
- Complete audit trails

### Requirements

#### Core Schema Extensions
- [ ] **Generations Management**: Complete generation tracking with metadata
- [ ] **Style Guide System**: Brand guides, vertical guides, writing styles
- [ ] **Multi-Vertical Support**: Content variants for different industries
- [ ] **Provider Configuration**: API keys, models, usage tracking
- [ ] **Context Management**: Template and context reuse system
- [ ] **Generation Trees**: Version control and branching for content
- [ ] **Analytics Schema**: Token usage, costs, performance metrics

#### Database Design Requirements
- [ ] Extend existing Prisma schema (don't replace)
- [ ] Support PostgreSQL JSON fields for metadata
- [ ] Implement soft deletes for content recovery
- [ ] Create proper indexes for performance
- [ ] Design for horizontal scaling
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data (API keys)
- [ ] Support concurrent generations

#### Integration Requirements  
- [ ] Maintain compatibility with existing blog system
- [ ] Support user authentication integration
- [ ] Plan for multi-tenant capability (future)
- [ ] Database migration strategy from existing data

### Dependencies
- Existing Prisma schema (`/prisma/schema.prisma`)
- Current blog data structure
- User authentication system
- PostgreSQL database

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All schemas validate without errors
- [ ] Migrations run successfully on existing data
- [ ] Repository pattern implemented with proper abstractions
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements (< 100ms queries)
- [ ] Seed data includes initial vertical guides
- [ ] Development fixtures support testing
- [ ] Database supports all planned user flows

### Resources
- **Architecture Doc**: `/docs/ai/AI_COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **User Flows**: `/docs/ai/USER_FLOWS_COMPLETE.md`
- **Model Config**: `/docs/ai/AI_MODELS_CONFIG_2025.md`
- **Existing Schema**: `/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Frontend Components**: `/docs/ai/FRONTEND_COMPONENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Understand Existing Code First**
   - Read current schema thoroughly
   - Understand existing relationships
   - Preserve all current functionality
   - Don't break existing blog features

2. **Follow Existing Patterns**
   - Use same naming conventions
   - Follow existing relationship patterns
   - Match current authentication integration
   - Maintain consistency with current indexes

3. **Design for Scale**
   - Plan for high-volume AI generations
   - Consider storage costs for large content
   - Design efficient queries for tree operations
   - Support concurrent users

4. **Data Privacy & Security**
   - Encrypt API keys at database level
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Audit sensitive operations
   - Support GDPR requirements (soft deletes)

### Questions to Resolve Before Starting
- Should we partition large tables by date?
- How long to retain generation history?
- What's the strategy for API key rotation?
- How to handle generation cleanup preferences?

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Schema designed and documented
- [ ] All migrations written and tested
- [ ] Repository classes implemented
- [ ] Seed data created
- [ ] Performance tested with sample data
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Ready for API agent integration

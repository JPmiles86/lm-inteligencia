### Objective
Build complete React-based user interface for AI content generation system, providing intuitive workflows for content creation, multi-vertical generation, style guide management, and generation tree navigation.

### Context
Create a sophisticated but user-friendly interface that supports both simple "one-click generation" and advanced multi-step workflows. Must handle complex state management for generation trees, real-time streaming, and multi-vertical content coordination.

### Requirements

#### Core UI Components
- [ ] **AI Content Dashboard**: Main container with provider/model selection
- [ ] **Generation Workspace**: Primary work area with content editor
- [ ] **Context Selection Modal**: Intuitive context building interface  
- [ ] **Generation Tree**: Interactive tree navigation and branching
- [ ] **Multi-Vertical Generator**: Parallel/sequential generation management
- [ ] **Style Guide Manager**: Guide creation, editing, and version control
- [ ] **Image Generation Panel**: Imagen/DALL-E integration with prompt editing
- [ ] **Social Media Generator**: Multi-platform post creation

#### Advanced UI Features  
- [ ] **Real-time Streaming**: Live generation display with progress
- [ ] **Drag & Drop**: Content organization and tree manipulation
- [ ] **Split View**: Side-by-side comparison for multi-vertical
- [ ] **Auto-save**: Background saving with conflict resolution
- [ ] **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power user efficiency features
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts
- [ ] **Dark/Light Themes**: User preference support

#### State Management
- [ ] **Redux/Zustand Store**: Comprehensive state management
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket/SSE integration
- [ ] **Optimistic Updates**: UI responsiveness during API calls
- [ ] **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent editing
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Basic offline functionality
- [ ] **Local Storage**: User preferences and draft content

#### User Experience Features
- [ ] **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and progress indicators  
- [ ] **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery
- [ ] **Notification System**: Toast messages and alerts
- [ ] **Onboarding**: New user guidance and tooltips
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] **Performance**: Lazy loading and virtualization

### Dependencies
- Backend API endpoints from Backend API Agent
- Database schema understanding
- Design system/component library decisions
- Authentication system integration

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All planned user flows work intuitively
- [ ] Multi-vertical generation provides clear progress tracking
- [ ] Generation tree navigation is smooth and responsive
- [ ] Context selection is efficient and saves user time
- [ ] Style guide management supports iteration workflows  
- [ ] Real-time streaming works without UI blocking
- [ ] Mobile experience is fully functional
- [ ] Performance meets standards (< 3s initial load, < 1s interactions)
- [ ] Accessibility standards met
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Resources
- **Component Architecture**: `/docs/ai/FRONTEND_COMPONENTS_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **User Flows**: `/docs/ai/USER_FLOWS_COMPLETE.md`  
- **API Specifications**: Backend API Agent documentation
- **Design System**: Existing Tailwind configuration
- **Architecture**: `/docs/ai/AI_COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Complex State Management**
   - Generation trees require sophisticated state handling
   - Multi-vertical generation needs progress coordination
   - Real-time updates must not conflict with user edits
   - Context management involves many interconnected pieces

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Large content trees can impact performance
   - Streaming content needs efficient rendering
   - Image generation results require proper loading states
   - Virtual scrolling for long content lists

3. **User Experience Priorities**
   - One-click generation must be truly simple
   - Advanced features shouldn't overwhelm beginners
   - Error states need clear recovery paths
   - Loading states should show meaningful progress

4. **Integration Complexity**
   - Real-time streaming from multiple providers
   - Different provider capabilities need unified UX
   - Generation tree operations must be atomic
   - Context building involves many data sources

### Design System Approach
- Build on existing Tailwind configuration
- Create reusable component library
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Proper color schemes for different content types
- Icon system for generation states and actions

### Testing Strategy
- Component testing with React Testing Library
- Integration testing for complex workflows  
- Visual regression testing for UI consistency
- Accessibility testing with automated tools
- Performance testing with realistic data loads

### Questions to Resolve Before Starting
- What's the exact design language/brand guidelines?
- Should we build a component library or use existing?
- How to handle very large generation trees (1000+ nodes)?
- What's the mobile vs desktop usage priority?

### Progressive Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Core Generation (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Basic dashboard with provider selection
- [ ] Simple generation workflow  
- [ ] Content editor with Quill integration
- [ ] Basic context selection

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Weeks 3-4)

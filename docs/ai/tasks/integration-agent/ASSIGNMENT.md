# Task Assignment: AI Provider Integration
## Agent: Integration Agent
## Date: 2025-08-25  
## Priority: High

### Objective
Implement seamless integration with all 4 AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity), creating a unified abstraction layer that handles provider-specific features while maintaining consistent interfaces for the application.

### Context
Each AI provider has unique capabilities and APIs. Create robust integration layer that maximizes each provider's strengths while providing fallback capabilities and unified error handling. Must support advanced features like reasoning effort control, thinking budgets, web search, and image generation.

### Requirements

#### Provider-Specific Integrations
- [ ] **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-5 Responses API, GPT-4.1 Chat Completions, DALL-E/GPT-Image
- [ ] **Anthropic Integration**: Claude models with proper headers and caching
- [ ] **Google Integration**: Gemini models with thinking control, Imagen 4.0 variants
- [ ] **Perplexity Integration**: Sonar models with search configuration and citations

#### Advanced Provider Features
- [ ] **OpenAI**: Reasoning effort, verbosity control, web search, custom tools, structured outputs
- [ ] **Anthropic**: Prompt caching, extended thinking, vision capabilities, streaming
- [ ] **Google**: Thinking budget control, multimodal inputs, batch processing, structured responses
- [ ] **Perplexity**: Academic search, domain filtering, date filtering, async operations

#### Unified Abstraction Layer
- [ ] **Provider Factory**: Dynamic provider selection and instantiation
- [ ] **Request Normalization**: Convert app requests to provider-specific formats  
- [ ] **Response Normalization**: Standardize responses across providers
- [ ] **Error Mapping**: Consistent error handling across all providers
- [ ] **Fallback Logic**: Automatic provider switching on failures
- [ ] **Rate Limit Handling**: Provider-specific rate limit management

#### Content Processing Pipeline
- [ ] **Prompt Engineering**: Provider-optimized prompt templates
- [ ] **Context Injection**: Style guides and examples integration
- [ ] **Response Parsing**: Extract structured data from responses
- [ ] **Image Processing**: Handle image generation and optimization
- [ ] **Citation Extraction**: Process Perplexity search results
- [ ] **Token Counting**: Accurate token estimation and tracking

### Dependencies
- Backend API service layer
- Provider API keys and configurations
- Database repositories for caching
- Content parsing utilities

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All providers work reliably with their full feature sets
- [ ] Provider switching and fallbacks are seamless
- [ ] Response times meet performance requirements
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents API violations  
- [ ] Cost tracking is accurate across all providers
- [ ] Error handling provides meaningful feedback
- [ ] Caching reduces redundant API calls
- [ ] Token usage predictions are accurate

### Resources
- **Provider Guides**:
  - `/docs/ai/OPENAI_API_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
  - `/docs/ai/GOOGLE_GEMINI_USAGE_GUIDE.md`  
  - `/docs/ai/PERPLEXITY_API_USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- **Model Configuration**: `/docs/ai/AI_MODELS_CONFIG_2025.md`
- **Architecture**: `/docs/ai/AI_COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Critical Implementation Notes

1. **Provider-Specific Nuances**
   - OpenAI: Responses vs Chat APIs, reasoning/verbosity parameters
   - Anthropic: Message role handling, caching headers, streaming format
   - Google: Thinking budget control, safety settings, multimodal handling
   - Perplexity: Search configuration, citation extraction, OpenAI compatibility

2. **Error Handling Complexity**
   - Rate limit errors need provider-specific backoff strategies
   - Content filtering varies by provider
   - Model availability can change
   - Network errors require retry logic

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement intelligent caching strategies
   - Use streaming where beneficial
   - Batch requests when supported
   - Optimize for specific provider strengths

4. **Cost Management**
   - Accurate token counting for each provider
   - Real-time cost calculation
   - Budget alerting and limits
   - Usage optimization recommendations

### Integration Architecture

#### Provider Factory Pattern
```typescript
interface AIProvider {
  generateText(request: GenerationRequest): Promise<GenerationResponse>;
  generateImage?(request: ImageRequest): Promise<ImageResponse>;
  streamText?(request: StreamRequest): AsyncGenerator<StreamChunk>;
}

class ProviderFactory {
  createProvider(type: ProviderType): AIProvider;
}
```

#### Request/Response Normalization
```typescript
interface GenerationRequest {
  prompt: string;
  model: string;
  parameters: ProviderParameters;
  context?: GenerationContext;
}

interface GenerationResponse {
  content: string;
  metadata: ResponseMetadata;
  usage: TokenUsage;
  citations?: Citation[];
}
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each provider integration
- Integration tests with real API calls (using test accounts)
- Fallback mechanism testing
- Rate limit handling validation
- Error scenario coverage
- Performance benchmarking

### Security Considerations
- API key encryption and rotation
- Request/response logging (excluding sensitive data)
- Rate limit monitoring and alerting
- Provider-specific security requirements
- Compliance with provider terms of service

### Questions to Resolve Before Starting
- How to handle provider-specific model deprecations?
- What's the strategy for A/B testing different providers?
- Should we implement request caching at the integration layer?
- How to handle provider-specific content filtering?
